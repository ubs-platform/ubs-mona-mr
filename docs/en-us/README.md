## Synopsis

UBS Mona is a rest API framework developed around NestJS, which aims to develop backend with little code, and uses mostly MongoDB. It includes very basic functions such as User Login/Logout, socialization (commenting), notifications. The name Mona is formed by combining the names "MOngo, Nest, Angular"
